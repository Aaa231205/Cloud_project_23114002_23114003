Assignment 3
Design and Implementa on of a Secure Cloud Applica on Architecture with
Automated Threat Modeling and Risk Mi ga on
Assignment Type: Design & Implementation

Problem Statement
Modern cloud applications are increasingly exposed to security threats due to their
distributed and internet-facing nature. This assignment focuses on designing and
implementing a secure cloud application architecture that integrates automated threat
modeling, risk assessment, and mitigation mechanisms.

Objec ves
- Design a secure cloud application architecture
- Perform automated threat modeling and risk analysis
- Implement automated threat detection and mitigation
- Evaluate system resilience under simulated attacks

System Requirements
The system must consist of the following components:
1. Client
2. API Gateway / Reverse Proxy
3. Application Server(s)
4. Data Storage Service
5. Security Monitoring and Logging Module

Tasks
Task 1: Secure Cloud Architecture Design
Design a secure architecture highlighting trust boundaries, data low paths, and security
enforcement points. Secure communication between components must be implemented.
Task 2: Authen ca on and Authoriza on
Implement token-based authentication and role-based access control. Logs must record
successful and failed access attempts.
Task 3: Automated Threat Modeling
Apply a formal threat modeling methodology to identify threats and assess risks. Simulate
multiple attack scenarios such as brute-force attacks and denial-of-service.

Task 4: Automated Risk Mi ga on
Implement automated mitigation mechanisms including rate limiting, IP blocking, and
account lockout. Mitigation actions must trigger automatically without manual intervention.

Task 5: Resilience and Recovery Evalua on
Evaluate system behavior under attack and partial service failure. Measure detection time,
mitigation time, and system availability.

Logging and Evidence
Submit logs capturing authentication events, detected threats, mitigation actions, and
recovery behavior. Screenshots must be provided as execution evidence.
